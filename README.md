## Anime Recommendation CLI

### Description

This CLI allows a user to get top publicly rated anime recommendations based on genre. The user can also save the animes theyâ€™ve watched to the database, along with their personal rating of that anime. They can then get recommendations based off of their own top rated genres. All recommendations exclude any anime the user has already watched, and users under the age of 18 will only get G and PG recommendations.

### Install Instructions:

* Run bundle install to install all gems.
* Run rake db:migrate to create the database.

### Usage:

* Run bin/run.rb in terminal and interact as instructed.
